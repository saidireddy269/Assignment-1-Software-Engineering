Explination:- it's an Infinite Loop in Python. it occurs whien a condition always occurs to be true. it's an error. for Instance we might have  a loop which decrements until it's 
Zero. or in Python it occurs if the conditon of while loop is always True.


n = 0 
k = 0
while ((n <= 2) or (n >= 12)):
    print ("Enter integer n such that 2 < n < 12: ")
    print (n);
while (k <= 10):
    print ("Enter upper limit k for x and y (k > 10)");
    print (k)
miss=100
relativMiss = 100
for x in range(10,k):
    for y in range(10,k):
        lhs=(pow (x, n) + pow (y, n))
        if (lhs < 0):
            print ("OVERFLOW ERROR!! Choose lower values of n and k")
            return 0
    z = pow (lhs, 1.0/n)
    diff = lhs - pow (z, n)
    if ((pow (z + 1, n) - lhs) < diff) :
            diff = pow (z + 1, n) - lhs
            z=z+1
            relDiff = 100. * diff / lhs;
            if (relDiff < relativMiss):
                miss = diff;
                relativMiss = relDiff;
